                <span  className='font-bold'>There are five main types of state  manage in React apps</span>
                
               
                <p><span>Server state</span>
                is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage all side of our local and global UI state.
                </p>
                <p><span>Global state</span>
                  is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.
                </p>
                <p><span>Local State</span>
                 is data  manage in one or another component.Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.
                </p>
                <p><span> URL state</span>
                is often missing as a category of state, but it is an important one.In many cases, a lot of major parts of our application rely upon accessing URL state.
                </p>

        <div className='border p-5 m-5 rounded shadow'>
            <h2 className='text-2xl'>How does prototypical inheritance work?</h2>
            <p><span  className='font-bold'> JavaScript objects</span> have a link to a prototype object. It is a method which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf</p>
        </div>
        <div className='border p-5 m-5 rounded shadow'>
            <h2  className='text-2xl'>Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts</h2>
            <p>Ypu can't called state directly ,calling the callback state.Because you can't directly update the initial value.example,const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). there products is a initial value,you can't update a intial value so we set a function as like as setProducts.</p>
        </div>
        <div  className='border p-5 m-5 rounded shadow'>
            <h2   className='text-2xl'>You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?</h2>
            <p>If I have an array of products. Find the product name i use,Filter method.
                Look like that,products.fliter method use then get every product.We show product.name.
